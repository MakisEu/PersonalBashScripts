# Scripts
A repo to store the bash script I created to make my life easier

Scripts:

        ➡️ PlayRSSVideo: Play a youtube video using yt-dlp and mpv from a link and add link to history file.
        
        ➡️ BashHistorySaver: Save terminal history permanently into a file and clear bash_history to speed up terminal
